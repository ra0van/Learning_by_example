	A pointer can be any of these:
		. pre defined data type
		. enum
		. user defined struct that contains fields of unmanaged types only
		
	Pointer types cannot be inherited from an object.
	A pointer type cannot be converted to an object and vice versa.
	However, we can convert between different pointer types.
